## Game Introduction

PingPong is a classic game that simulates table tennis. Players control a paddle to hit the ball back and forth with an opponent. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot return it, thereby scoring points.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:** The game begins when one of the two players serves the ball. Players can use control keys (e.g., up/down arrows or W/S keys) to move their paddle.

2. **Controlling the Paddle:** Use the control keys to move the paddle up or down, block the ball, and hit it back towards the opponent.

3. **Scoring Points:** A player scores a point when the ball passes the opponent's paddle and hits the back of the play area. The game ends when one of the players reaches a certain number of points (e.g., 10 points).

4. **Strategy:** Players can change the direction and speed of the ball by hitting it at different positions on their paddle.

Enjoy the game and aim for a high score!
